# Hungry Snake Game in Python
#### This was most of our favorite game when we were kids. We can actually code this game in python by importing just two modules! How cool is that!

# Let’s get started!

#### If you don’t have it already installed, open your cmd and type in the following command.

```
C:\Users\Admin>pip install turtle
```
#### Now we will install the random module. The random module is used to generate random numbers. In your cmd type in the following command.

```
C:\Users\Admin>pip install random2
```

## Code and Try it yourself and enjoy the game!

# Thanks
